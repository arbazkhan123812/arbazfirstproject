      <h1>Albert Einstien</h1>
      <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation E=mc^2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared) is perhaps the most well-known equation in physics, expressing the equivalence of mass and energy.
        Einstein made numerous other contributions to theoretical physics, including his work on the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. He also made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.
        Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was also a prominent advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and international cooperation. He was a vocal critic of nationalism, militarism, and authoritarianism. Einstein's fame extended far beyond the scientific community, and he remains one of the most recognizable figures in history.</p>
      
      <h1>Education</h1>
       <ol>
        
        <li>Early Education: Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on March 14, 1879. His family moved to Munich when he was a child. He attended elementary school in Munich and was an average student in most subjects, although he excelled in mathematics and physics.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Secondary Education: At the age of 15, Einstein moved to Switzerland to complete his secondary education. He attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich briefly before moving to the Cantonal School in Aarau, Switzerland, where he finished his secondary schooling.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>University Studies: In 1896, Einstein enrolled at the Polytechnic Institute (now the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in Zurich, Switzerland. He initially intended to study mathematics and physics to become a teacher. However, he was more focused on independent study and often clashed with his professors due to his unconventional thinking.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Doctorate: After graduating from the Polytechnic Institute in 1900, Einstein continued his studies at the University of Zurich, where he obtained his doctorate in 1905. His doctoral dissertation was titled "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions."</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Post-Doctoral Work: Following his doctorate, Einstein struggled to find academic positions due to his unorthodox views and difficulty conforming to academic norms. He worked briefly as a patent examiner in Bern, Switzerland, where he developed many of his groundbreaking ideas in theoretical physics, including the theory of relativity.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h1>``Nobel Prize``</h1>
      <p>Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect." This award recognized his groundbreaking work on the photoelectric effect, which he published in 1905 as part of his Annus Mirabilis papers, a series of four papers that revolutionized physics and laid the foundation for modern quantum theory.</p>
      <p>The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to light. Einstein's explanation of this effect proposed that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons. This work not only provided compelling evidence for the existence of photons but also helped to establish the quantum theory of light, which had profound implications for the understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.</p>

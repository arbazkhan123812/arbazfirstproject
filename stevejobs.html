            <h1 id="head1"> Steve jobs </h1>
            <p>Steve Jobs, born Steven Paul Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, was an American businessman, inventor, and investor renowned for co-founding Apple Inc., NeXT, and Pixar. He played a pivotal role in the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s alongside Steve Wozniak. Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976, leading to the successful Apple II and Macintosh computers. After leaving Apple in 1985, he founded NeXT and later contributed to the visual effects industry through Pixar. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, revitalizing the company with iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Despite battling health issues, Jobs continued to innovate until his death in 2011, receiving posthumous recognition, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2022

            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>Steve Jobs' educational journey was unconventional and marked by his pursuit of knowledge outside traditional academic paths. Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, briefly in 1972 but dropped out after just six months due to the mismatch between the structured curriculum and his passion for practical, technology-focused learning
                 Despite not earning a degree, his time at Reed College was influential as he audited classes that resonated with him, notably calligraphy, which later influenced Apple's design philosophy
                 Jobs' decision to drop out was driven by his desire for practical, technology-focused knowledge and a reluctance to burden his parents with the high costs of education that he found irrelevant to his aspirations
                 This departure from formal education did not deter Jobs from pursuing knowledge independently. He continued to audit classes that interested him, like calligraphy, showcasing his preference for self-directed learning focused on his specific interests
                 This alternative approach to education played a significant role in shaping Jobs' success and his innovative contributions to the tech industry, challenging the notion that traditional education is the sole path to innovation</p>

                After leaving Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc., a hardware and software company, and later acquired Pixar Animation Studios, which produced popular films like "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo"
                In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO, leading the company to new heights with groundbreaking products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which reshaped modern technology and consumer electronics
